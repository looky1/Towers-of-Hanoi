# Towers-of-Hanoi
Created a Towers of hanoi game with unity!

# Platform: Unity Engine
# Reason for Choice:
-I chose Unity because leveraging a game engine for this project is a smart decision. itâ€™s purpose-built for tasks like this. While the same result could be achieved with a different language, Unity allows me to accomplish it with significantly less code, streamlining development. This efficiency not only enhances productivity but also makes the game easily scalable, as I avoid managing thousands of lines of code.

-Unity is one of the most widely-used game engines, providing a versatile platform for 2D and 3D games. It includes:

-Physics simulations (used for disk movement and collisions in this project).

-A flexible editor for scene design

-Cross-platform compatibility for deploying the game on multiple devices. Unity's event-driven workflow aligns perfectly with this project's interactive nature, where user input (dragging disks) drives gameplay.

# How to play:
Objective is simple. Move all disks from leftest most picket to rightest most picket in the same way it was placed in the leftest most picket.
For mechanics of the game to move a disk you have to drag and drop. Hold left-click on the uppermost disk and then release left-click to drop it on a picket.
after completing the level a win screen pops up, giving you the option to progress to the next level or quit the application. 

# Installation
click on releases on my github profile and download the Towers on hanoi zip file. Then extract the zip file. Then click ToH(it will have the unity symbol looks like a black box).
